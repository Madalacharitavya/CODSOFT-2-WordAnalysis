Certainly! Let's go through the provided Java code for the Word Analyzer:

1. **Import Statements:**
The code starts with import statements to include necessary classes: `java.util.HashMap`, `java.util.Map`, and `java.util.Scanner`.

2. **User Input:**
The main method begins by creating a new instance of the `Scanner` class to read user input. The user is prompted to enter some text.

3. **Word Count:**
The `countWords` method takes a `String` input (`text`) and returns the total number of words in that input. It uses the `trim()` method to remove leading and trailing spaces and then splits the text into words using the regular expression `\\s+`, which matches one or more whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.). The length of the resulting array gives the count of words.

4. **Unique Word Count:**
The `countUniqueWords` method also takes a `String` input (`text`) and returns the number of unique words in that input. It uses a `HashMap` called `uniqueWordsMap` to store each word as the key and its frequency as the value. It iterates through the array of words (obtained by splitting the input text using `\\s+`) and updates the frequency count in the map accordingly. The size of the `uniqueWordsMap` at the end gives the count of unique words.

5. **Word Frequency Calculation:**
The `calculateWordFrequency` method takes a `String` input (`text`) and returns a `Map` containing each word as the key and its frequency as the value. Similar to the `countUniqueWords` method, it uses a `HashMap` called `wordFrequencyMap` to store word frequency. It iterates through the array of words (obtained by splitting the input text using `\\s+`) and updates the frequency count in the map accordingly.

6. **Printing the Results:**
In the `main` method, after obtaining the user input, it calls the `countWords`, `countUniqueWords`, and `calculateWordFrequency` methods to get the word count, unique word count, and word frequency map, respectively.

7. **Displaying Results:**
The code then displays the results to the user:
   - The total number of words in the input text.
   - The number of unique words in the input text.
   - The word frequency map, which shows each word and its frequency in the input text.

8. **Loop and Exiting:**
The code provided doesn't include a loop, so it only processes a single input text. If you want to analyze multiple texts, you can wrap the main code inside a loop or modify it to ask the user if they want to analyze more texts.

Overall, the Java code analyzes a given input text, counts the total words, unique words, and provides a frequency map of each word along with its occurrence count in the text.
